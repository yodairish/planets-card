The rocket's upper stages were able to reach then-record altitudes of up to 399 kilometers (248 miles), higher than even modern space shuttles fly.

Not a surprising discovery, but the use of instruments to detect traces of life in a planet's atmosphere will be useful as future space probes continue to seek evidence of life beyond Earth.\nGalileo's cameras captured unique never-before-seen views of Antarctica and also the Earth and Moon together - a glimpse at what someone from another world might see as they approached our little piece of the solar system."
