Long before and after flying by Jupiter, Pioneer 10 transmitted data on the magnetic fields, energetic particle radiation and dust populations in interplanetary space. As it passed through the Jupiter system, it transmitted hundreds of photos of the planet and its moons, along with measurements of the Jovian atmosphere.\nTracking Pioneer 10 and 11 as they sped away from the sun revealed what came to be called the \"Pioneer Anomaly\" - the spacecraft traveled about 5,000 km less than expected each year. In 2012, scientists announced the slight, but detectable effect of heat pushing back on the twin spacecraft explains unexpected slowing."

The probe measured temperature, pressure, chemical composition, cloud characteristics, sunlight and energy internal to the planet, and lightning. During its 58-minute life, the probe penetrated 200 km (124 miles) into Jupiter's violent atmosphere before it was crushed, melted, and/or vaporized by the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere."

Its images of Io revealed changes in the moon's surface and the persistence of its volcanic eruptions.

Jupiter's atmosphere was found to be more active than during the visits of Pioneer 10 and 11, sparking a rethinking of the earlier atmospheric models which could not explain the new features. The spacecraft imaged the moons Amalthea, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, showing details of their terrain for the first time.\nPossibly the most stunning of Voyager 1's discoveries was that Io has extremely active volcanoes, powered by heat generated by the stretching and relaxing the moon endures every 42 hours as its elliptical orbit brings it closer to and then farther from Jupiter. This finding revolutionized scientists' concept of the moons of the outer planets. The spacecraft also discovered a thin ring around the planet (then making it the second planet known to have a ring), and two new moons: Thebe and Metis.\nVoyager 1 entered interstellar space in August 2012."

It also presented an unprecedented chance to simultaneously study a gas giant planet from two different spacecraft. Mission controllers also used the flyby for a final test of the spacecraft's systems before the primary mission began.",
        "Accomplishments": ": Scientists used joint observations from Cassini and the Galileo spacecraft to reveal Jupiter's magnetosphere, a vast, invisible whirling bubble of charged particles surrounding the planet. The data revealed how Jupiter interacts with particles from our Sun. The results helped scientists understand Earth's own magnetosphere, which shields us from harmful solar radiation. Cassini also revealed Jupiter's radiation belts to be much harsher than expected -- information that will help engineers protect future robotic spacecraft -- and spotted new details in Jupiter's auroras."
