        "Accomplishments:": " Beagle 2 was targeted to land in Isidis Planitia, a large flat sedimentary basin on Mars, but mission controllers were unable to contact the lander. After an extensive search for signals by orbiting spacecraft, the mission was declared lost."

An investigation found the most likely cause of the mishap was a false signal that the spacecraft had landed when in fact it had only deployed its legs and was still descending. The signal shut down the main engines and the spacecraft crashed into Mars at high speed."

Phoenix's cameras also returned more than 25,000 pictures from sweeping vistas to near the atomic level using the first atomic force microscope ever used outside Earth. The findings advance the goal of studying whether Mars could ever have been favorable to microbial life."
